<p>Hi, I’m Nick!</p>
<p>
	I lead a team of consultants at Instructure that provide technical expertise for Canvas LMS. This
	includes stuff like API usage, IdP configuration, data integrations, customized branding and more.
</p>
<p>I like building tools, solving problems and learning new things.</p>
<p>
	I started learning development through writing Ruby scripts and command line tools to make HTTP
	requests or perform a task.
</p>
<p>
	We also built an electron app to provide a UI to simplify data remapping and help make it more
	accessible to other teams. It was later built directly into an internal data platform, not bad
	…right?
</p>
<p>
	I also built and maintain reactive browser extensions across department teams in Svelte.js to
	perform functions and provide templates for an increasing number of web apps like JIRA and Asana.
	It turns out a lot of time can be saved with just a few APIs.
</p>
<p>In my spare time I read, build, and tinker a lot with software. It’s fun …why not?</p>
<h4>tl;dr</h4>
<p>
	I enjoy the thrill of solving a difficult or unfamiliar problem, learning something new, or
	simplifying a task.
</p>
<p>But also food.</p>
