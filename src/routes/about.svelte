<h3>Hi, I’m Nick!</h3>
<p>I lead a team of consultants at Instructure where we provide clients and developers expertise on technical aspects of implementation for Canvas LMS. This includes SIS data integrations, branding customization, and authentication troubleshooting.</p>

<p>I like building tools, solving problems and learning new things.
I started learning software development through writing Ruby scripts and command-line tools to make HTTP requests or perform a task.</p>

<p>I later built an Electron app designed to simplify SIS data conversions and make them more accessible to non-technical teams. It was later built directly into an internal data platform, not bad…right?</p>

<p>I also built and maintain a reactive browser extension in Svelte that performs tasks across multiple web-apps to help automate and simplify technical tasks. It turns out a lot of time can be with the right APIs.</p>

<p>In my spare time I read about, build, and mess around with software.</p>

<h3>Tl;dr</h3>
<p>I enjoy the thrill of solving difficult or unfamiliar problems, learning new things, or simplifying tasks. And also food.</p>
